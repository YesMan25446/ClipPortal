# Clip Submission Site

A simple, responsive layout for submitting video clips. Users can provide a title, link a hosted video (YouTube, Twitch, direct URL), or upload a file, and add a short description.

## Getting started

- Open index.html in your browser.
- Adjust styles in styles.css.
- Client-side behavior lives in script.js.

## Structure

- index.html — main page with the submission form and guidelines
- styles.css — base styling and layout
- script.js — lightweight interactivity and validation
- assets/ — place images or other static assets here

## Notes

This is a static prototype. Hook the form up to your backend or serverless endpoint to process submissions.
